On August last year,I began to look forward to the future,I found I was so unsure.

Considering the prospect of my major,discrimination against undergraduate in civil engineering industry and 
the most important thing that I want to settle down in a city with my future wife Jiajia Lee, I decided to 
dicerted and finally chose to learn computer science.

I don't know this is God's will or not. I prayed for his leading in my whole life and strengthen my weak faith.

I once prefered to take part in the post-graduate entrance exam.But after a period of study,I felt I wasn't
in a good state and didn't have gift. I gave up and was upset. It seemed that I lost the self-learning ability
and the confidence.

I began to look for interships and improve professional capbility,expecting to find a job this year. And then,
a scheduled intership flew away. 

It hit me again and forced me to think some problems. Was I walk in God's will? What was my real mind? I struggled 
with self-righteousness for a long time and still do now.

During the past time, I just learned,learned,learned without thinking what I was doing or what I got. Tonight,I 
accept the offer from the first and only company I interviewed. I want to make the computer science my love. I 
want to summarize and make progress. I want to communicate with technical coder. 

And I want to live with God,treat Jiajia Lee gently,help people.

Go!
